# Surfs_Up

## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis was to use SQLite and SQLAlchemy modules in python for exploring the Hawaii weather data
and analyse different weather parameters like precipitation and temperatures in order to mitigate any doubt the investor might have
regarding the safety of his investment.

## Results

Temperature Analysis for the month of June and December 

1.) June :

2.) December :

From the screen shots above we can very well se that there is no significance diffence in temperatures in June and December.

1.) Min temperature is 64 degress in the month of June and it drops by 7 degrees to 56 in the month of December

2.) Mean Temperature decreases by 4 Degrees for the month of December.

3.) While there is only a 2 degree in max temperature fopr the month of June and December

4.) We need to determine rate of precipitaion as well as temperatures for different months so it becomes much easier to determine the profitabilty in different months
and how it will get impacted by the weather.

## Summary

As mentioned before in the above results the difference in min, max and mean temperatures for the month of June and December are minor.
We need to analyse temperatures for other months and also analyse the monthly precipitation in order to get a clear picture about the months in which teh surf shack will be the most profitable

1.) Query to extract temperature and precipitation for each station in the month of June and December :

2.) Similarly like we determined temperature we can also determine min,max and mean precipitation for the month of June and December
